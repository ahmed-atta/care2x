1. Make sure that you've configured your PHP for production use.

 check for following values in your php.ini:
 error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED
 display_errors = Off
 display_startup_errors = Off
 log_errors = On
 
2. Make sure that the template_c folder and its subfolders is writable

This belongs for linux/unix users - for xampp there is no configuration needed at this section.
There are two ways for linux settings

option 1: make sure that this folder has the same group write permissions like the apache is

-> check /etc/passwd for the user assigned to your httpd and make an chown for this folder

option 2: make an chmod 777 for this folder. 

3. manual installation of database

Log in to your mysql and 

3.1 create a database

example: mysql> create database care2x;

3.2 import the database-dump

You'll find the database at /install/mysql/manual

Easiest way is to locate under Windows mysql.exe and prompt for - under linux it should be 
available everywhere you are. The command is: 

mysql -u[username] -p[password] [DBname] < [database-dump]

Example: #mysql -uroot -psecret care2x < /install/mysql/manual/care2x.sql

4. Call it by webbrowser and: Have fun ;-)
