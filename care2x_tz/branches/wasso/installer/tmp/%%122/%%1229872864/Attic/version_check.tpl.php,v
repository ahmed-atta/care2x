	<li>Install Database Schema: database schema that is the backbone of a properly working Care2x system will be installed. </li>
	<li>Create Administrator User: the Care2x administrator user that you will use later for initial configuration of the system will be created. </li>
	<li>Save System Configuration: the system configuration of the system will be saved on the hard drive. </li>
	<li>Install Optional DB Tables: you will be asked to choose wheather to install option database tables as ICD10 and OPS301 codes. </li>
	<li>Rename Critical Installation Files: finally, some critical installation files will be renamed for security reasons. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above steps does not need user interaction and you may not notice their existance. </p>
