<b>Wheres the Edit button?</b><br>
<p>
In the Manage Payment screen there is no 'Edit' button. This is to provide a proper 'audit trail' of payments recorded in Simple Invoices.<br><br>
If you've made a mistake with a payment entry the best option is to reverse the entry and entery it again correctly<br>
<br>Reverse the entry - what the?<br> This basically mean just doing a negative entry for the same amount as the original entry.
<br><br>
ie.<br>

If your entered $110<br>
but you should of entered $1100<br>
to reverse this entry enter -$110 against the same invoice and then enter the correct amount of $1100<br>
