<b>Aging:</b> The 'Aging' field indicates how long the invoice has been unpaid for.  The possible values for ths field are 0-14, 15-30, 31-60, 60-90, and 90+.  If the invoice was created on the 1st of the month, at the 21st of that month if the invoice still had not been made in full the invoice 'Aging' would be in the 15-30 days group. <br><br>
If the invoice has been paid in full then the 'Aging' field will be blank.<br><br>
Why use Aging groups? This help you quickly see where your invoices are at in terms of how long they have gone without being paid in full. But why? because the more of the invoices that are older and unpaid represent cash you dont have. If to many of your invoices are getting on in age then you may start to have cash flow issues - you dont want this.
