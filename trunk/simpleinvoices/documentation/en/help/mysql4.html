<b>MySQL 4 and below</b><br>
<p>
As you are using MySQL 4 or below as your database server some features of Simple Invoices have been disabled. Some sql queries in Simple Invoices have taken advantage of new features in MySQL 5, so things like the quick reports here on the start page, some debtors reports and a few other features of Simple Invoices have been disabled.
