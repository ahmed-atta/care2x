INSERT INTO `care_menu_main` ( `nr` , `sort_nr` , `name` , `LD_var` , `url` , `is_visible` , `hide_by` , `status` , `modify_id` , `modify_time` ) 
VALUES ('', '17', 'Billing', 'LDSimpleinvoices', 'modules/simpleinvoices/index.php', '1', '', '', 20030922232015 , NOW( ));

Step 2.
-------
Modify the file include/care_api_classes/MenuVisibility.php

Modifie the the line with var $matches:

  var $matches = array("Admission"=>"admission", "Medocs"=>"medocs", "Doctors"=>"doctors", "Nursing"=>"nursing",
  "OR"=>"op", "Laboratories"=>"lab", "Radiology"=>"radio", "Pharmacy"=>"pharma",
  "Medical Depot"=>"meddepot", "Directory"=>"teldir", "Tech Support"=>"tech",
  "System Admin"=>"System Admin", "Special Tools"=>"Special Tools",

After this step you could access care2x and the 'Billing' option will be apearing in the left hand side menu. Please click on the menu option 'Billing' it will display a screen with the a long list of messages. On the top you will get to see a link 'Update'. Please click on the update link which will then take you to the menu options.
