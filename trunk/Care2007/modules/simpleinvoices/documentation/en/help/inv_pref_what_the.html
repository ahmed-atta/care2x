<b>Invoice Preference fields</b><br><br>
<b>Whats all this "invoice Preference" stuff about?</b>
<p>
Invoice Preferences allows you to define the wording of the invoice.  You can have as many different "Invoice Preferences" defined in Simple Invoices as you want, but you can only select 1 "Invoice Preference" per invoice.
<br><br>
ie. If you wanted the heading of the invoice to say "Moes Tavern - Invoice" instead of the default "Invoice", you can edit the "Invoice heading" field in the relevant Invoice Preference to achieve this result
