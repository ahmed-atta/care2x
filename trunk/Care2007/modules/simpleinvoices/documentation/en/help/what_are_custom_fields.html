<b>What are Custom Fields?</b><br>
<p>
Custom Fields are special fields in billers, products, customers, and invoices that you can label as whatever you want. 
<br><br>
Wish there was a Tax ID field in biller, just go to the Custom Fields page and define one of the blank Biller Custom Fields as Tax ID.
<br><br>
Now when you go to edit a Biller there'll be a new field there called Tax ID or whatever you specified it as
