<b>Database backup information</b><br>
<p>
For the backup to work the webserver user(hopefully your running Apache) must have read/write permissions to the database_backups directory in the Simple Invoices folder<br>
<br>
Also if you are extra paranoid (like me :) ) about your data I recommend using phpMyAdmin.  This backup script should work fine but if require 'enterprise grade' backup reliability phpMyAdmin rocks
<br><br>
Note: If you are using Simple Invoices in the demo environment on SourceForge backups wont work due to setup of their servers
