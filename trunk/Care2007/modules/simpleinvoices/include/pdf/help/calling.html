  passed using both the GET and POST methods. Script parameters (in alphabetical order) are:</p>

<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>batch[]</td>
<td>Specify a list of URL for "batch-processing" mode here</td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td>compress</td>
    <td>Set this option to generate compressed Postscript files. You'll probably 
      only need this option only if you're working with Postscript (NOT PDF) files 
      via Adobe Acrobat Distiller, as it does not support compressed Postscript. 
      In any other case, use compressed Postscript, as it will save on bandwidth.
<p>PDF files may be compressed, but you will need to unpack them manually before viewing.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>cssmedia</td>
    <td>HTML page can contain stylesheets for different target media types; for 
      example, the printable version of a page may have navigation panes and banners 
      hidden, while the version for handhelds may be specially formatted to work 
      on small displays and so on. By setting the value of this parameter, you 
      determine which set of CSS rules will be used during PS/PDF rendering.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td>debugbox</td>
<td>
<p>Set this option if you want to see boundaries of all boxes generated by the script. 
It is unlikely you'll need this option, as it is mostly for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>Please note if you're using this option that the script renders the <i>content</i> 
boundary which is different from the &quot;normal&quot; box border!</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>encoding</td>
    <td>Encoding can usually be automatically detected using HTTP response header 
      or META tags inside the HTML. Sometimes, encoding information is missing; 
      you can specify encoding name as a value of this parameter.</td>

<td>html2xhtml</td>
    <td>If you're absolutely sure you have valid strict XHTML page, you can set 
      this option to disable HTML-to-XHTML conversion and speed up script execution 
      a little. In any other case, do not set this option, as the script will 
      not work with non-well-formed XML. Use this option at your own risk; if you encounts any 
      errors first enable the HTML-to-XHTML conversion.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>landscape</td>
    <td>Set this parameter to rotate the media to landscape orientation. Please 
      note that the 'virtual resolution' will remain the same; all page content 
      will be scaled to fit the new page width.</td>

          window). Note it will not work for Postscript files in most cases, they 
          will be downloaded as usual;</li>

      the higher level you use, more features can this PDF contain. On the other 
      hand, high-level PDFs may not be readable by older viewer versions:

<tr class="odd">
<td>pixels</td>
<td>
      <p>'Virtual screen' horizontal resolution used during the page rendering 
        process. As you know, a lot of HTML pages contain dimensions set in pixels 
        -- images, in most cases, but sometimes fonts. Postscript/PDF files do 
        not have &quot;pixels&quot;, all dimensions are measured in &quot;points&quot; 
        so we need to provide information about the pixel/point ratio. In our 
        case, this ratio can be calculated as follows: </p>
      <pre>R = (page full width in points - page horizontal margins in points) / virtual resolution</pre>

      <p>Thus, you can specify resolution in 800 pixels and make pages designed 
        for 800x600 resolution to fit your printed page exactly.</p> 
      <p><tt>index.php</tt> provides three default values for this parameter: 
        640, 800 and 1024; if you need more exotic value, say 945, you may specify 
        this in the script query string manually and still get correct results.</p> 
      <p>Please note that pages may be cut off on the right side if they're designed for the higher resolution 
than you've specified (for example, if they have hardcoded table widths or wide images). It is a feature.
In such cases please consider increasing 'pixels' value.</p>

If this parameter have value of '3', the script will generate Postscript Level 3; 
otherwise &ndash; Postscript Level 2. Default value is '3'. This parameter does not affect PDF generation.

<tr class="even">
<td>ps2pdf</td>
<td>Flag indicating whether script should convert generated Postscript file to PDF using Ghostscript utility. 
Note that generally script does not prevent you to enable this filter for 'fpdf' and 'pdflib' methods, but
this will result in conversion error.</td>

is present (even if it has empty value)</td>

is present (even if it has empty value)</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>scalepoint</td>
<td>
      <p>When a page contains both device-dependent (in pixels) and device-independent 
        (in points) dimensions, we're in trouble. For example, imagine a page 
        containing absolute-positioned text inside the image; in this case, as 
        display and paper have different sizes, point/pixel ratio will be different 
        in the browser window and file rendered by the script, possilibly breaking 
        the page layout. To prevent this, the <tt>scalepoint</tt> option is used. 
      </p>

      <p>If this parameter is set, the HTML page &quot;points&quot; are scaled 
        to keep the mentioned ratio, so if you print the resulting file and measure 
        fonts, they will be smaller than you expect, but the page layout will 
        be exactly the same as you see in browser window (well, close to it). 
        If you want fonts to have their real size, disable this option.</p>

<p>Note that this additional scaling applies to points only; such units as in, cm, mm and pc 
are not affected by this option.</p></td>

<td>URL</td>

      this value automatically in case no http or https protocol part is found,
