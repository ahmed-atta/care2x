		<p>
		<b>NOTE:</b> The following installation procedure is valid for the beta 1.0.02.
		<p>
		If your system has a built-in Apache-PHP-mySQL configuration you can skip the first 4 steps.<p>
			<b>1. </b>Download and install Apache web server in your system.<p>
			<b>2. </b>Download and install PHP engine in your system.<p>
			<blockquote>
			Make sure that the "gd" device is installed in your PHP engine. The dll involved here is the php_gd.dll .
			Please consult the documentation of PHP in activating the gd device.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>3.</b> Download and install mySQL database in your system.<p>
			<b>4.</b> It might be necessary to configure the Apache web server to run PHP scripts as CGI.
			<blockquote>
			Please refer to the documentation of Apache in doing this configuration.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>5.</b> Download the CARE 2002 beta 1.0.02 scripts in ZIP format (if you have not done it yet).<p>
			<b>6.</b> Uncompress  the CARE 2002 beta 1.0.02 scripts into the active directory of Apache web server (default: /httpdocs).
			<blockquote>
			Please refer to the documentation of Apache in configuring the active directory if you decide to use a different directory name.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>7.</b> Use an editor and open the file "inc_db_makelink.php" in the directory "/include" of the uncompressed CARE 2002 scripts.  
			<blockquote>
			Enter the proper host, username, and password information for your mySQL database. If your mySQL resides on the same machine
			and uses the same IP address as the Apache web server you can use the default settings. <p>The defaults are:<br>
			host = 'localhost'<br>
			username = 'httpd'<br>
			password = '' (empty string)
			<p>
			Enter the database name. You must remember this name since you need it in creating the database in later steps.<p>
			For example:  $dbname = "mydb";
			
			
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>8.</b> Open the file "inc_remoteservers_conf.php" in the directory "/global_conf".  Enter the domain or ip addresses and hosts information.
			<blockquote>
			Note: If the web server is within a network enter specifically the IP adresses for the hosts. Never use "localhost".
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>9.</b> Open the file "inc_init_crypt.php in the directory "/include". Change the following three secret keys with unique keys of
			your choice. <P>
			<blockquote>
			$key           : The secret key for the first level script lock.<br>
			$key_2level  : The secret key for the second level script lock.<br>
			$ley_login     : The secret key for the third level script lock.
			</blockquote><p>
<b>REMEMBER: DO NOT PROCEED TO THE FOLLOWING STEPS UNTIL YOU HAVE CHANGED THE SECRET KEYS!<p>
			</b>			
			
			<b>10.</b> Start the Apache web server.<p>
			<b>11.</b> Start the mySQL.<p>
			<b>12.</b> Start your web browser. Currently, we recommend using the MS Internet Explorer version 5 or 
			higher due to pending completion of cross-programming the javascripts.<p>
			<b>13.</b> Type the following address in your browser:
			<blockquote>
			http://????????/install/initialize.php <p>(where ???????? is the actual host address of your Apache web server). The program module phpmyAdmin should be
			displayed.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>14.</b> Using the program phpmyAdmin create a new database naming it with  the name that you entered earlier in step 7.<p>
			<b>15.</b> Within the newly created database create the tables. 
			<blockquote>
			To do this use phpmyAdmin to run the following sql script "care_db_structure.sql" found in the /install/mysql/ directory.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>16.</b> NOTE: As of beta 1.0.02, a temporary Admin access permission is automatically created after you have
			run the sql script described in preceding step #15. The temporary admin data are:<p>
			<blockquote>
			username = Admin<br>
			password = Admin
			</blockquote><p>
			VERY IMPORTANT! In step #19 you will be required to change these initial admin access data with the data of your
			own choice.
			<p>
			
			<b>17.</b> Create the remaining tables. Note: In creating these tables you must follow the order of running the sql scripts as stated here.
			<blockquote>
			Using phpmyAdmin run the following sql scripts found in the /install/mysql/icd10_de directory in the following order: (these are the data for
			the ICD10 coding system in german language)<p>
			createtable.sql<br>
			a2g-insert.sql<br>
			h2n-insert.sql<br>
			o2s-insert.sql<br>
			t2z-insert.sql
			<p>
			Similarly run the following sql scripts found in the /install/mysql/icd10_en directory in the following order: (these are the data for the
			ICD10 coding system in english language) <p>
			create-table.sql<br>
			insert-data-a2l.sql<br>
			insert-data-m2y.sql<br>
			<p>
			Similarly run the following sql scripts found in the /install/mysql/ops301 directory in the following order:(these are the data for the
			OPS301 coding system in german language)<p>
			ops-create-table.sql<br>
			insert-data-1-5-499.sql<br>
			insert-data-55-57.sql<br>
			insert-data-58-94.sql<br>
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>18.</b> The installation is finished. Enter the following address in the browser:
			<blockquote>
			http://????????/ <p>(where ???????? is the actual host address of your Apache web server). 
			The first page of CARE 2002 should appear. Congratulations!
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>19.</b> CHANGE NOW THE ADMIN ACCESS INFORMATION!  <p>
				<blockquote>
		Select the EDP link on the left menu
			and then select "SQL Databank". Enter "Admin" as username and "Admin" as password. When the phpmyAdmin
			 appears, open the "mahopass" table. Edit the entry containing the following data: 
			<p>mahopass_name=Admin  
			<br>mahopass_id = Admin
			<br>mahopass_password = Admin
			<p> Change the values of mahopass_id and mahopass_password with values of your choice.
			<p>Now you can start (if you wish) creating access permission for other users. <p>
		Select the EDP link on the left menu
			and then select "Access rights". Enter your admin username and your admin password. When the 
			interface appears, you can start creating user access rights and permissions.
			<br>Note: You cannot create additional Admin permission
			using this interface.
