Installation

If your system has a built-in Apache-PHP-mySQL configuration you can skip the first 4 steps.

1. Download and install Apache web server in your system.

2. Download and install PHP engine in your system.

3. Download and install mySQL database in your system.

4. It might be necessary to configure the Apache web server to run PHP scripts as CGI. 
   Please refer to the documentation of Apache in doing this configuration. 

5. Download the CARE 2002 scripts in ZIP format.

6. Uncompress the CARE 2002 scripts into the active directory of Apache web server (default: /httpdocs). 
    Please refer to the documentation of Apache in configuring the active directory if you decide to use a different directory name.
	 
7. Use an editor and open the file "db-makelink.php" in the directory "/req" of the uncompressed CARE 2002 scripts. 

	Enter the proper host, username, and password information for your mySQL database. 
	If your mySQL resides on the same machine and uses the same IP address as the Apache web server you can use the default settings. 

	The defaults are:	
		
		host = 'localhost'
		username = 'httpd'
		password = '' (empty string) 

	Enter the database name. You must remember this name since you need it in creating the database in later steps.

	For example: $dbname = "mydb"; 

8. Open the file "remoteservers-conf.php" in the directory "/global_conf". Enter the domain or ip addresses and hosts information. 

	Note: If the web server is within a network enter specifically the IP adresses for the hosts. Never use "localhost". 

9. Start the Apache web server.

10. Start the mySQL.

11. Start your web browser. Currently, we recommend using the MS Internet Explorer version 5 or higher.

12. Type the following address in your browser: 

		http://????????/install/initialize.php 
	
		(where ???????? is the actual host address of your Apache web server). The program module phpmyAdmin should be displayed. 

13. Using the program phpmyAdmin create a new database naming it with the name that you entered earlier in step 7.

14. Within the newly created database create the tables. 

		To do this use phpmyAdmin to run the following sql script "care_db_structure.sql" found in the /install/mysql/ directory. 

15. Now create your Admin access permission. Run the following sql query: 

		INSERT INTO mahopass (mahopass_name,mahopass_id,mahopass_password,mahopass_area1,exc) VALUES ('your-normal-name','your-username','your-password','System_Admin',1); 

16. Create the remaining tables. Note: In creating these tables you must follow the order of running the sql scripts as stated here. 

	Using phpmyAdmin run the following sql scripts found in the /install/mysql/icd10_de directory in the following order: 
	(these are the data for the ICD10 coding system in german language)

		createtable.sql
		a2g-insert.sql
		h2n-insert.sql
		o2s-insert.sql
		t2z-insert.sql 

	Similarly run the following sql scripts found in the /install/mysql/icd10_en directory in the following order: 
	(these are the data for the ICD10 coding system in english language) 

		create-table.sql
		insert-data-a2l.sql
		insert-data-m2y.sql

	Similarly run the following sql scripts found in the /install/mysql/ops301 directory in the following order:
	(these are the data for the OPS301 coding system in german language)

		ops-create-table.sql
		insert-data-1-5-499.sql
		insert-data-55-57.sql
		insert-data-58-94.sql

17. The installation is finished. Enter the following address in the browser: 

	http://????????/ 

	(where ???????? is the actual host address of your Apache web server). 
	The first page of CARE 2002 should appear. Congratulations! 

18. Now you can start (if you wish) creating access permission for other users. 
	Select the EDP option and then select "Acess rights". 
	Enter your Admin username and password that you created in Step 15. 
	When the interface appears you can start creating access permissions. 
	Note: You cannot create additional Admin permission using this interface.
