Updating to Beta 1.0.02.

NOTE: Update files are only useful if you already have a running Care 2002 installation. 
      Otherwise, download the entire beta 1.0.02 package and install it. Follow the 
	  installation procedure. The installation document is available from http://care2x.com.
	  
HOW TO UPDATE TO Beta 1.0.02 ?
-------------------------------
1.) Download the update files from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/care2002/ if you have
not done it yet.

2.) Uncompress the files into a temporary directory.

3.) There are new  directories in the beta 1.0.02. Create these  directories manually in
your current Care 2002 installation.
   
     /development
     /development/dev-docs
     /development/script-templates
	 
     /pear
     /pear/crypt
	 
     /include

4.) Copy the update files to their respective directories in your current Care 2002 installation. Follow
the directory tree of the updates files to know the appropriate directories.

5.) Delete the /req directory from your current installation. This directory will not be supported anymore
in the future releases.

6.)Open the file "inc_init_crypt.php in the directory "/include". Change the following 
three secret keys with unique keys of your choice. 

			$key           : The secret key for the first level script lock.<br>
			$key_2level    : The secret key for the second level script lock.<br>
			$ley_login     : The secret key for the third level script lock.
		
REMEMBER: DO NOT PROCEED TO STARTING THE PROGRAM UNTIL YOU HAVE CHANGED THE SECRET KEYS!

7. That's all. You can now start the Care 2002 using your browser.
