phpPgAdmin Installation Guide
-----------------------------

1. Unpack your download

   tar -xvzf phpPgAdmin-*.tar.gz

2. Configure phpPgAdmin

   edit phpPgAdmin/conf/config.inc.php

   If you mess up the configuration file, you can recover it from the
   config.inc.php-dist file.

3. Set up the reports database.

   If you want to enable reports (which are a useful feature) then go to
   the 'sql' subdirectory and view the SQL script for your database.  It
   will contain instructions on how to set up the reports database.

4. Browse to the phpPgAdmin installation using a web browser.  You might
   need cookies enabled for phpPgAdmin to work.

5. IMPORTANT - SECURITY

   PostgreSQL by default does not require you to use a password to log in.
   This means that if you set up phpPgAdmin where the world can see it,
   someone could just come along and type username 'postgres' or 'pgsql'
   with no password and easily log in as a super user.

   We STRONGLY recomment that you enable md5 passwords for local connections
   in your pg_hba.conf, and set a password for the default superuser account.
