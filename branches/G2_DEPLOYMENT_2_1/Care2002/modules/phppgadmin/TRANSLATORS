Translator Info
---------------

If you like phpPgAdmin, then why not translate it into your native language?

Translation is slightly complicated in phpPgAdmin compared to other PHP software,
since we support viewing database encodings that are different to your language
encoding.

To translate messages, you will need to install GNU Recode on your computer.

GNU Recode: http://www.gnu.org/software/recode/recode.html

Your favourite OS should have a GNU Recode package available. (See Bottom For Details)

Once you have Recode installed, these are the steps to creating a new translation:

1. Go to the lang/ subdirectory

2. Copy english.php to yourlanguage.php

3. Update the comment at the top of the file.  Put yourself as the language maintainer.
   Edit the 'applang' variable and put your language's name in it, in your language.
   Edit the 'appcharset' variable and put in the name of the encoding for your language.

4. Go through as much of the rest of the file as you wish, replacing the English strings
   with strings in your language.

5. Edit the Makefile in the lang/ directory and add an entry for your new language.  Note
   that the parameter for Recode is "yourcharset..HTML".

6. Run the Makefile by typing 'make yourlanguage'.  A recoded language file will appear
   in the lang/recoded/ directory.  If the recoding fails, then fix the error in your
   language file and try again.

7. The HTML encoded language file is what phpPgAdmin actually uses to display
   localised strings.  Have a look at the recoded file to see how the HTML encoding
   works.  By encoding your language like this, we can display your language's
   characters as well as the characters of the language in your database.

8. To add your language to phpPgAdmin's login screen, edit libraries/lib.inc.php and add
   your language to the $appLangFiles array.  You must include the HTML encoded version
   of your language's name.  You can get this from the recoded version of your translated
   strings file.

9. Send your contribution to us.  We need the lib.inc.php entry as well as the
   yourlanguage.php file in lang/.  We don't need the recoded file as we can recode it
   ourselves before committing it.

10. Thank you for your contribution!  You have just made phpPgAdmin accessible to
   thousands more users!

11. There exists a tool named 'langcheck' in the lang/ directory.  To run it, just type
   'php langcheck <language>'.  It will give you a report about which strings are missing
   from your language file and which need to be deleted.
