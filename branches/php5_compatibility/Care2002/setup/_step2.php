We have ran a few cursory checks to make sure everything is kosher with your system setup.  The results
of the tests are listed below.  Please note the following definitions:<br />

<dl>
	<dt>Messages</dt>
	<dd>
		Things that look all good are labeled as messages, and are for your information only.  If all
		goes well, you will see alot of these.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Warnings</dt>
	<dd>
		Things that COULD be a problem later on, but won't stop you from installing, are labeled as
		warnings.  You may ignore these <i>at your own risk</i>, using your judgement based on the
		specific warning you recieve.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Errors</dt>
	<dd>
		Things that are definite problems for the application are labeled as errors. If these are not
		solved, the application is all but guaranteed to fail.  You will not be able to install the 
		application until this list is clear.
