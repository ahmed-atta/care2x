Data setup in navigation files such as this one will allow you to add sections
to the 'Admin menu' that only the admin user can see.  There are 2 types of
nodes you can add:

 (1)    a SGL_NODE_ADMIN node
        These will appear at the top level in the admin menu
 (2)    a SGL_NODE_GROUP node
        These will appear as a subsection of the node inserted previously

Using this logic you can create node groups that correspond to modules, with a
SGL_NODE_ADMIN as the designated parent, and all children designated as
SGL_NODE_GROUP nodes.
