DESCRIPTION
***********
After installing, you can create a new block using the block-manager with name "RndMsgBlock". 
This will create a block on your site with a random message comming from  the database.


INSTALLATION
************
Generate the table in your database using the provided sql-script.
(use a new (= not existing) id for the record in the module-table)

Run the pear DataObject creation script, to generate the new dataobject

copy RndMsgBlock.php into seagull/app/modules/block/classes/blocks

copy the rndmsg directory with classes, lang and templates subdirectory into seagull/app/modules

copy rndmsgMgr.php into seagull/www



If everything is done ok, you'll have run the dataobject-script
and you'll have a directory-tree like this:
