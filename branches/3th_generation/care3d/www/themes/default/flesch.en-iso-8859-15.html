<H3>Flesch Score</H3>
<p>
The Flesch score is the result of some basic readability metrics performed on
the article you've written.  The number of words, the number of sentences,
and the number of total syllables have been taken into account.
The Flesch score for a sentence represents the readability of the text,
and is  a number usually between 0 and 100.  A basic breakdown of scores is:
