INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SEAGULL FRAMEWORK
==========================================

Seagull is organised so there's minimum fuss involved setting it up for the
first time.  The main thing you need to do is:

** MAKE THE seagull/var DIRECTORY WRITABLE BY THE WEBSERVER **

This document makes reference to an [web-doc-root] which typically is

    /var/www/html on Linux and
    C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\htdocs on Windows

QUICKSTART
==========

1.  Download the archive called 'Seagull: whole package' from Sourceforge and
    uncompress it.  You will get a folder called seagull-<version_no>, rename
    this to seagull and place it in your web document root.

2.  Make the following directory writable by the webserver

        [web-doc-root]/seagull/var

3.  Navigate to [web-doc-root]/seagull/www in a browser, depending on how you've
    set your document root this could be

        http://localhost/seagull/www

4.  Follow the steps set out by the interactive installer


DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

1.  Download the archive called 'Seagull: whole package' from Sourceforge and
    uncompress it.  You will get a folder called seagull-<version_no>, rename
    this to seagull

2.  Make the [web-doc-root]/seagull/var directory writable by the webserver.  If
    *nix, you can achieve this by making the user the webserver runs under
    owner of the seagull/var directory, so if your webserver runs as
    'nobody':

    $ chmod 777 [web-doc-root]/seagull/var

    [OPTIONAL] If you'd like to be able to upload images using the WYSIWYG editor
    in Publisher you'll need to make the following directory writable by the
    webserver too:

    $ chmod -R 777 [web-doc-root]/seagull/www/images

3.  Next configure your webserver to serve pages from Seagull's www directory.
    You generally have the following options:

    - if you setup a virtual host in Apache, point it to the

        [web-doc-root]/seagull/www

      directory.  Your seagull domain will look like

        http://seagull.example.com

    - if you're on a shared server, install Seagull at the root level. Your
      seagull domain will look like

        http://example.com/seagull/www

    - to setup an installation locally, put the Seagull directory in your web
      folder. Your seagull domain will look like

        http://localhost/seagull/www/

4.  Once you launch Seagull by requesting http://<seagull-domain>/index.php in
    a web browser, an installer routine will create the schema and populate the
    database with the required default data.  Currently MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle
    schemas are provided.

    If you have any problems during the install routine, delete the config file
    created by the system in the var directory, and the file called
    INSTALL_COMPLETE.php, and start again.  Typical problems are:

    - providing incorrect db login details
    - not setting write perms to the var directory
    - trying to import data when a database doesn't exist
    - trying to import data when the default data already exists

5.  Login by clicking the login link in the top right corner and entering the
    relevant admin credentials you specified during installation.  Using the
    admin section you can begin to put Seagull to work.
