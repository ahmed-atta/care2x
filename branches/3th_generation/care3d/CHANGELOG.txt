            ****************************************************************************
            VERY IMPORTANT: if you make a change to modules/yourmodule/conf.ini, you
            MUST use the 'Delete cached configuration files' option from the Maintenance
            screen for it to be picked up.
            ****************************************************************************
14-03-07    Updated scriptaculous to 1.7.0 (Julien Casanova)
13-03-07    Added isAuthenticated() to SGL_Output
07-03-07    File operations on module config files now happen exclusively in
            SGL_VAR_DIR, ie seagull/var.  So the config file for the default module
            is now automatically copied to seagull/var/config/default.ini.  And the
            original file located at seagull/modules/default/conf.ini currently serves
            only as a master copy.
02-03-07    Configurable install root path implemented
27-02-07    Added isChecked utility method to Output class, usage:

            http://trac.seagullproject.org/wiki/Howto/CSS/Handling#ModulespecificCSS)
05-02-07    Added ability to add custom data to your modules, makes it easier to diverge
            from svn code, create file called data.custom.my.sql for this purpose
30-01-07    Added SGL_Task_InitialiseModules() task, this gets executed before
            the filter chain and looks for any file called init.php in the root
            of any active module
22-01-07    Input URL parsing strategies now configurable
18-01-07    Category block now parameterized and is configurable

            to override default values
10-01-07    New SGL_Image library fully integrated, see

            (Dmitri Lakachauskis)
10-01-07    Added amf-php integration, SGL_Request_Amf is now a request type

10-01-07    Added SGL_String::toValidVariableName() in addition to existing
            toValidFileName()
05-01-07    Added ability to customise modules during install
            (Dmitri Lakachauskis)

            implementation based on request type (Browser, Ajax, Cli)
02-01-07	Added ability to set a custom master template in config
			(Peter Termaten)
30-12-06	Added ability to include remote js files (Steven Stremciuc)
28-12-06    Added onunload handling (Steven Stremciuc)
28-12-06    Added SGL_Util::getTmpDir(), tmpdir tests now work on Mactel
27-12-06    Added an overlay debug block, displays system info
24-12-06    Updated scriptaculous libs to 1.6.5
23-12-06    Added addCssFile() helper method to SGL_Output, Sometimes you may
            want to include a stylesheet from a vendor lib. In the same way
            Output.php provides a addJavascriptFile(), you can now pass a
            stylesheet with :
                $output->addCssFile(/*string/array*/ $cssFile)

            (failed install, no global config file, failed request init)
10-12-06    Added addHeader($header) and getHeaders() to SGL_Output
02-12-06    Added SGL_Output::addJavascriptFile() which accepts either a single path
            or an array of paths of js files.  The preferred way of adding javascript
            files to page has changed
                FROM (in validate() method)
            $this->javascriptSrc = array('/path/to/file1.js', 'path/to/file2.js');
                TO (in display() method)
            $output->addJavascriptFile('/path/to/file1.js', 'path/to/file2.js');
            The old method is still supported

29-10-06    Tables removed from all templates in user module, replaced with xhtml
            compliant markup (Dmitri Lakachauskis)

27-10-06    Cleaup of SGL_Config behaviour:
                - to load global config: $c = &SGL_Config::singleton();
                - to save global config: $c->save();
                - to load any secondary config: $c = new SGL_Config();
                                                $config = $c->load('/path/to/file');
                                                $c->replace($config);
                - to save any secondary config: $c->save('/path/to/file');
            Replace method takes into accout you may want to load many config files
            but manipulate the data before passing it back to Config object for saving
26-10-06    Some very nice functionality added to the comment module including
            Akismet integration (Steven Stremciuc)
20-10-06    Added example REST client and server implementations (
              http://trac.seagullproject.org/browser/branches/0.6-bugfix/lib/SGL/Services/REST/Client.php
            and
              http://trac.seagullproject.org/browser/branches/0.6-bugfix/docs/developer/examples/modules/REST_server
            respectively, including custom filter chain for server (see conf.ini).

04-09-06    Deprecated DA_Default::moduleIsRegistered() in favour of
            SGL::moduleIsEnabled()
03-09-06    Upgraded PEAR libs including HTML_Ajax, note: you now have to call
            DAOs with their correct case, eg in html href:
            {webRoot}/ajaxServer.php?client=all&amp;stub=MediaDAO
            and in js: var remoteHW = new MediaDAO(hwCallback);
