<P>
<P>2/1/07 Got webERP logo showing on footer.inc in report writer scripts. Updated copyright to change year on title.
<P>2/1/07 Fixed bad bug that didn't post freight on Credit_Invoice.php script!!! This resulted in control account out of balance issues.

<P>30/11/06 DB_connect_mysql and DB_connect_psql added a DB_show_tables function to abstract this one in the report writer.
<P>29/11/06 BOMs.php removed dependency on mysql num rows and mysl_fetch_array functions and used abstraction functions as per the rest of the application. Modifications to consistency of braces use of prnMsg. Bug fixes as per Till

There is one modification required to avoid the dependency on PEAR's raiseerror function - this now refers to the webERP prnMsg function - otherwise updates to this module can be imported as necessary. Needs some testing with other Locales to check translation. It is only used in the PrintChecks.php script.

Also completes the purchorderdetails and updates the purchase order line quantity to be the quantity received to avoid the possibility of receiving additional stock against this line

<P>16/9/06 SupplierInvoice.php GoodsReceived.php added a field to grns table to allow the standard cost at the time of receiving to be recorded in the GRN record rather than the purchorderdetails table - this allows for multiple receipts against a purchase order to be at different costs - required for average costing. SupplierInvoice.php now has code to deal with average costing GL entries and cost updates. Also deals with where the invoice is for a quantity more than is left in stock now - writes off the variance on the shortfall. GoodsReceived now tracks the weighted average of all receipts of a purchase order line so that the quantity received multiplied by the stdcostunit = sum of all cost received against the line.
<P>16/9/06 New script Z_Upgrade_3.04-3.05.php required to bring cost data over to the grn records to fit with the new schema of allowing different drops of stock received to be booked in at different costs. Previously

<P>12/7/06 Z_RePostGLFromPeriod.php did not work correctly from periods into the business since bfwd balances were zeroed rather than using the previously bfwd balance - now fixed.
<P>11/7/06 SupplierTransInquiry.php allows supplier transactions to be listed with GL transactions created for each.
<P>11/7/06 Alan J report_runner.php now allows command line arguments to run reports using the php interpreter directly.

<HR>

<P><P>Version 2.9
<P>17th July 2004
<P>
<P>Upgrade script 2.8 - 2.9 is necessary to be applied against a 2.8 database - unfortunately I was over zealous with the foreign keys and made up one for StockID in ShipmentCharges - this needs to be dropped but the name of this key is generated by Innodb so I cannot create a script to ditch it!! You will need to remove this yourself - otherwise you will not be able to create shipment charges. Using the new db scripts will of course generate dbs without this foreign key.

<P>15/7/04 Polishing Credit_Invoice.php SelectCreditItems.php using new DB_query function for error messages and checking all working with controlled items.
<P>11/7/04 Jesse serial items input from file added - fixed inconsistencies with other scripts.
<P>7/7/04  header.inc now has a link to a Help.php page Help.php added and new tables Help and Scripts. Help contains the context sensitive help referenced to the script - which is where the scripts table comes in. It contains all the scripts in the system with an overview of what the script does. The new Help script retrieves records from the Help table relevant to the PageID, the PageID is determined from the filename looked up against the Scripts table. Users can add new help and edit or delete help. A little shy on data for the help table!!
<P>19/6/04 GLBalanceSheet.php displays a html balance sheet for any period end.
<P>17/6/04 AccountGroups now uses an array for Section in accounts defined in config.php $Sections array. This array also used in GLProfit_Loss.php
<P>17/6/04 GLProfit_Loss.php added - index.php modified to add a link to this script
<P>8/6/04 DefineCartClass.inc updates to DB new parameters for delete, remove, add to cart class - changes to SelectIntoCartClass and other scripts to pass appropriate variables rather than rely on SESSION['ExistingOrder']. Also DecimalPlaces field added to order data in add_to_cart.
<P>8/6/04 Updates to SelectOrderItems.php now uses new DB_query error message/debug message parameters
<P>8/6/04 SelectCreditItems.php now uses Quantity not QtyDispatched - bug corrected.
<P>5/6/04 New script StockSerialItems.php shows the stock status of serial or controlled items - the total shown should tie up with the StockStatus total quantities on hand.
<P>29/5/04 New script StockTransfersControlled.php allows input of serial items for stock transfers.
<P>29/5/04 New script StockAdjustmentsControlled.php allows input of serial items for stock adjustments.

<P>17/5/04 StockMoves remove field BundleID
<P>17/5/04 StockCheck.php now only prints stock sheets for items committed to the stockcheckfreeze table. Behaviour of this script was counter intuitive. Deletion of existing entries deleted all locations stock of the same range of categories - now corrected.
<P>17/5/04 Added DecimalPlaces tinyint default 0 to StockMaster - this determines the number of decimal places to show for the stock item in all places where the item is displayed. Yet to update displaing throughout the system.
<P>12/5/04	DeliveryDetails.php SelectOrderItems.php DefineCartClass.php - deleting lines off an existing order was not working correctly. It was possible to delete completed order lines off an order in changing an outstanding order line. Bad bug corrected.
<P>5/5/04	Added new tables for Serialised stuff StockSerialItems StockSerialMoves. Alterations to StockMaster for Serialised and DecimalPlaces - for displaying items with different decimal places

<P>25/4/04 StockLocTransfer.php - contributed by Chris Bice, creates a transfer from one location to another without creating the transaction but records the transfer in a pending transfers file. Also PDFStockTransfer.php and includes/PDFStockLocTransferPageHeader.inc creates the transfer paperwork. new table LocTransfers also required - in upgrade script.
<P>25/4/04 GLAccountInquiry.php modifications as contributed by Dirk Eversmann incorporated - now allows multiple periods to be selected and shows the transactions for the whole range of periods between the highest and lowest. Also the movement for each period. B/fwd balances and c/fwd balances only shown where the account is a balance sheet account. GL account is now selectable from a list rather than selecting as per customer or supplier - unlikely to be the same volume of GL accounts hence overhead of downloading all GL accounts over dial up (for the list) is deemed an acceptable compromise.
<P>22/4/04 PO_SelectOSPurchOrder.php made the location default properly to the users default location.
<P>22/4/04 Links for CurrencySuppliersBalances.php and CurrencyDebtorsBalances.php re-instated on Z_index.php - these scripts are for reconciling the creditors and debtors control accounts.
<P>22/4/04 bug fix in GoodsReceived.php - cost differences where std cost changed was not working correctly all cost was going to price variance rather than stock!! Serious bug.... now rectified.
<P>18/4/04 index.php now uses extra column where many options under one heading
<P>18/4/04 New scripts StockLocStatus.php - inquiry script that shows all stock items status in the selected category. StockLocMovements.php - inquiry script that shows all movements in the selected location and date range - default only one month - this script can return a lot of data and is a mistake to run over dial up on a business with many stock movemnts. Thanks to Chris Bice for these scripts. Also added links from index.php -
<P>2/4/04 config.php now over-rides php.ini to ensure tht NOTICES turned off.

<P>16/3/04 All scripts now have a comment for CVS version number - Dick Stins suggestion
<P>16/3/04 Fixed bug on new system where sales and COGS GL posting tables not set up - auto create a default GL account - foreign key could give problem if account groups modified so now auto creates a sales account group first - thanks Dick Stins

Version 0.2.0
26th July 2003

<P>(Phil)PDFOrderPageHeader.inc and PrintCustOrder.php now refer to the pre-printed stationery versions. These will have to be modified to suit the client. A packing slip format that is headed up is included in the distribution called PDFOrderPageHeader_generic.inc and PrintCustOrder_generic.php - may be better to have another link to this from the order.
<P>(Phil)CostUpdate.php now allows definition of two page security variables one that allows costs to be viewed and another that allows modifications to costs.
<P>(Phil)Prices.php now allows definition of two page security variables one that allows prices to be viewed and another that allows modifications to prices.
<P>(Phil)PO_OrderItems.php now has a button to lookup the purchase price of an item from the purchasing data this was automatic from the part search but where a code was entered directly, there was no lookup.
<P>(Phil)New field in CustBranch DefaultShipVia that gets updated at the time of invoicing (ConfirmDispatch_Invoice.php) if it was modified in an order.
<P>(Phil)PrintCustTrans.php and PDFTransPageHeader.inc modified to print the branch postal address instead of the head office address where the flag InvAddrBranch is set to 1

<P>(Phil)Payments.php now retains the bank account from which the amount is being paid.
<P>(Phil)Fixed bug in SelectCompletedOrders.php was not showing the delivery dates and qty delivered due to earlier changes to the DefineCartClass.inc calls to additem now given correct params.

<P>(Phil)Stopped order lines from being changed to 0 quantity

<P>(Phil)CustomerAllocations.php and SupplierAllocations.php made a rounding tolerance of 0.005 for allocations to be accepted.
<P>(Phil)Fixed bug in SuppPaymentRun.php to only print/process suppliers with an amount owing - it was picking up suppliers with debit balances ;(
<P>(Phil)Changed SupplierInquiry.php to retain date from when invoice is held or released.
<P>(Phil)Changed SelectOrderItems.php (again :( ) to avoid showing the last quick entry item as selected. unset($_GET["Edit"]) at the end of the quick entry code.

<P>(Phil)SuppTransGLAnalysis.php made general ledger account select box show account code and in account code order
<P>(Phil)Made SelectOrderItems.php search only branches - a branch is required to invoice/credit it makes sense to select the branch rather than the customer and then the branch. The customer is implicit in the branch selection. Also use flag DisableTrans to ensure that only those current branches are allowed invoicing.
<P>(Phil)Added DisableTrans on CustBranch table to disable a branch from being invoiced or credited to
<P>(Phil)Added a new field AddrInvBranch to DebtorsMaster to enable invoices to be addressed to the branch postal address. To cover the situation where branch invoices must be sent to the branch not the charged customer.

<P>(Phil)Fixed bugs in SelectSalesOrder.php was not using $_POST variables for SearchParts also was only searching parts with a sales order - need to show all parts then return orders for that part - no orders returned if no orders for the part selected.
<P>(Phil) SelectOrderItems.php now uses LIMIT as per SelectProduct.php to limit the number of parts returned on as per the config directive $Maximum_Number_Of_Parts_To_Show

<P>(Phil) Modified - the PrintCustOrder.php and PDFOrderPageHeader.inc to use php-pdf class and default for pre-printed stationery. Pre-printed 2 part stationery is necessary to record notes of storemen. This will require modification for the client's own stationery. Copied the labelled up scripts to PrintCustOrder_generic.php and PDFOrderPageHeader.inc these still require PDFlib installed on the server.
<P>(Phil) Modified ConfirmDispatch_Invoice.php back to remove selection of freight company.
<P>(Phil) Modified delivery details to allow selection of a freight company and to allow entry of a freight cost to charge - which can be either calculated by the system or entered manually.
<P>(Phil) Made new directive in config.php $DefaultPriceList this is used if the price cannot be determined first by reference to the customers salestype and currency.
<P>(Phil) Modifications to SelectOrderItems.php GetPrice function to use the $DefaultPriceList if fails using the customer salestype/price list. This minimises input in other sales type prices to only those prices which are special to the customer.
<P>(Phil) Fixed login page in header.inc to test for AccessLevel=="" and check for existence of SecurityGroups being an array as it should be.
<P>(Phil) Deleted redundant fonts from the distribution only using helvetica

Version 0.1.8
22 June 2003

<P>MailInventoryReport.php script similar to MailSalesReport.php to enable automated email of inventory report
<P>MailSalesReport.php script added - largely a copy of SaleAnalysis_UserDefined.php. This new script runs a user defined sales analysis report and mails it to an email account. This script has no PageSecurity nor any output - it creates a file then emails it as an attachement to the address(es) specified in the script. It is meant to be run from cron using wget to email a sales report periodically to staff concerned.
<P>GetSalesTransGLCodes.inc now looks for SalesType, Area match for finding a GL code match before using the default.
<P>SelectProduct.php - added a transactions column to the actions applicable on selection of an item with links to perform stock adjustments or stock location transfers.
<P>PO_Header.php - changed the link to the line items to be a button that diverts to the PO_Items.php only after updating the session variables for changes in the form data. Needs META refresh in the browser - most have this
<P>SupplierInvoice.php - changed links to enter invoice amounts against goods received, against shipments and against gl to buttons and made the page redirect after updating the session variables with the posted data in the form. Changes could be lost without hitting update. This method avoids the need for the update button - which has now gone.
<P>SupplierCredit.php was not using the default date format for transaction dates.
<p>Stocks.php check for stock on hand when changing to assembly or kitset or dummy. Also check for sales orders or purchase orders when changing to assembly kitset or dummy. Also check for BOM when changing to buy or dummy.
<p>SQL_CommonFunctions.php GetCompanyRecord function excluding the fields now removed from this table.
<p>CompanyPreference.php reflecting the changes in the companies table below
<P>Companies table modified - removed default bank account and bank act number field from companies table. Multiple bank accounts can now be defined seperately.
<P>Companies table modified removed credit check flag - always checked now
<P>Companies table modified removed check stock flag
<P>Modified all scripts to have the variable $PageSecurity also config.php to allow definition of security by user group
this mechanism allows for much finer control of who has access to what.
<P>Modified GLTrialBalance.php to retain periods selected as a starting point for when entering a new period range
<P>Modified Stocks.php to always convert stock codes to upper case.
<P>SelectOrderItems.php - orders for kitset items that explode the BOM into its components to order were doubling in quantity for each component in the BOM - now fixed.
<P>SelectOrderItems.php - selection of parts to order would not show assembly parts since no stock location records for these parts - no stock is maintained for them. No longer show stock on hand in the location nearest the customer in the part search.
<P>Shippers.php fixed to allow editing of shippers - link was malformed.
<P>GLJournal.php modified to retain processing date after an entry is deleted.
<P>New script Z_RePostGLFromPeriod.php reposts all GLTrans from a selected period.
<P>New format invoice A4 landscape PDF.
<P>New script GLAccountInquiry.php called from SelectGLAccount.php allows listing of the transactions for a specified
account. The transaction type and number shows with a link to the detail of the individual transaction ie "drill down"
to the lowest level of the transaction.
<P>New script InventoryPlanning.php allows listing of the current stock status, QOH, Purchase orders outstanding and sales orders outstanding together with the recent history of stock movements and suggests an order quantity based on a number of periods stock to hold.
<P>Logout link shown on header destroys any session data - a user requested this function - can't see why it is necessary but hey!
<P>New script BOMListing.php allows listing of bills of material defined for a specified range of items.
<P>New script InventoryValuation.php allows listing stock items with a quantity !=0 by location and stock category.
<P>Stocks.php after updating an item the user is returned to a new select item screen (SelectProduct.php?NewSearch=True)
<P>SalesPeople.php - checked so that cannot have zero length salesperson code.
<P>Dropped redundant tables Hedges, TempMRP, StandingJournals (standing journals can be created live at any time since user can post forward and backwards at will).
<HR>

Version 0.1.7
May 16 2003

<P>Costed BOM inquiry script - thanks Al Adcock.
<P>Modified Customers.php to always convert customer codes to upper case.
<P>Modified CustomerBranches.php to always convert branch codes to upper case.
<P>Modified StockCategories.php to always convert stock category codes to upper case.
<P>Modified Areas.php to always convert area codes to upper case.
<P>Modified PrintStatments.php to always convert customer from code and customer to codes to upper case.
<P>Modified SelectCustomer.php to always convert entries in either keywords or customer code extract to upper case.
<P>Modified SelectOrderItems.php to always convert search entries in either keywords or customer code extracts to upper case.
<P>MOdified SelectSupplier.php to always convert entries in either keywords or supplier code extract to upper case.
<P>Modified Suppliers.php to always convert the supplier code to upper case.
<P>Modified SalesTypes.php to always convert the sales type code to upper case.
<P>Modified SalesPeople.php to always convert the salesperson code to upper case.
<P>Modified SelectProduct.php to always convert the keywords or product code extract to upper case.

<P>Modified Locations.php to clear form variables for adding new locations and after updates to existing locations being modified. Made location codes always upper case.

<P>Some prawn changed the access rights of demonstration user so that one could only get into the order entry and account status screens. Made an admin user that has the rights to add or delete new users - prohibiting such destructive folks from malicious tricks in the sourceforge demo system.

<P>Modified SelectOrderItems.php to place the cancel whole order button away from the main entry - field testing showed that it was too easy to delete the order by hitting enter when the focus was on this button.

<P>New script to print bank reconciliation based on current gl balance of the bank account, showing bank payments not yet presented and deposits not yet cleared to arrive at a calculated bank statement balance. Links back to matching receipts and matching payments script. Also new link on index.php under GL inquiries.

<P>Added a link in index.php to allow re-prints of deposit listings produced from entry of receipts.

<P>New script for matching deposits and payments against bank statements, for the purposes of reconciling to bank statements. The script does double duty for matching deposits and payments, but must be called with either Receipts or Payments. Added appropriate links to this script in index.php one for Deposits matching and one for Payment Matching.

<P>Bug fix to GLTrialBalance.php the DefaultPeriodTo was not picking up the last defined period less one as was intended.

<P>Dropped the tables ClearedPayments and ClearedReceipts - amount cleared against banktrans now recorded inside the one banktrans table

<P>General Ledger Journal entry form created. New journal class defintion to hold the transaction before committing to the DB.
Reversing journals entered on same form by changing journal type to reversing, default is normal.
Prohibited journal entries directly to bank accounts since no banktrans record would be created for matching off statements.
Bank gl transactions must be entered as either a payment or a receipt.

<P>Removed facility to be able to modify the cost data for the part in the inventory item maintenance form since this did not create the
necessary GL journal if integrated stock journals are active. Cost changes must be effected through the dedicated form for this purpose.

<P>Entry of a payment to a general ledger act already defined as a bank account (be it a different bank account or the same bank account as the payment is from) now creates the necessary banktrans record for the receipt into the other (or same) bank account.
<P>Entry of a receipt to a general ledger act defined as a bank account now creates the necessary banktrans record for the payment from the other bank account as above.
<HR>
Version 0.1.6

22 Mar 03

<P>Fixed bug in SelectProduct.php script that overstated stock on hand.Sadly I couldn't figure a way to show the sales order demand and resolve
this problem so the selection of parts no longer shows current sales order demand.

<P>Additional error trapping to check that a stock location is not a default stock location for an existing customer branch
before allowing deletion.Also, an additional error trap to check that the default_shipper in config.php cannot be deleted from the shipper maintenance form
Further error trap to check that shipping companies that have debtortrans records (ie invoices created using them) cannot be deleted.
<HR>
Version 0.1.5

<P>User created with Access level less than or equal to 10 and with a customer code and branch code selected will be able to view
only the account details for the customer code selected with invoice reprints - only for the customers transactions. Such users
can also enter orders for the customer code and branch defined against them as well. This allows customers to be given access to the system
to view only their own details.

<P>Deleted PrintInvoice.php superseeded by PrintCustTrans.php which deals with credits and invoices

<P>logicworks.ini file changed name and all references to in other files to config.php to avoid displaying sensitive info in the
config file over the net ... duh! Thanks Ryan Fox!

<P>Sales Types - field to say if the sales type updates stock or not has been removed. This was a carry over from
some old logic that was superseeded.

<P>It was possible to add a sales type with a blank sales type code - now corrected

<P>Editing of a sales type was not possible - fixed.
<HR>

<P>Version 0.1.4

<P>23 Feb 03

<P>New page GLTrialBalance.php to show a trial balance with movements for a month and a period

<P>GLPostings.inc to effect updates to ChartDetails for GLTrans created

<P>New variable in config.php to define the company's year end

<P>ConfirmDispatch_Invoice.php - changed date format of date of dispatch field to refer to the $DefaultDateFormat
invoices commited with dates in US format became 00/00/0000. Now corrected.

<P>ChartDetails table - BFwd and BFwdBudget fields created.

<P>GLTrans table - removed reversal flag - reversing journals now create the reversal in the following period
at the time of entry no flag is necessary since the open period system with no rollovers requires creation of reversals at the time.
Also, dropped field ShiptRef - transactions now created in seperate tablef

<P>Payment.php - was not unsetting the fields when a new GL analysis line was added to the payment.

<P>Periods table - LastDateInPeriod field changed from DateTime to Date.
<HR>

<P>Version 0.1.3

<P>1 Feb 03

<P>Payments.php insert of BankTrans record now records Currency and TransNo and Type correctly.

<P>Allocation of supplier payments and credits - creating GL entries and exchange diffs.
Made SuppAllocs table mirror CustAllocs refering to the TransID rather than the Type and TransNo as previously.
SupplierAllocations.php and links from SupplierInquiry.php

<P>Changed DateFunctions.inc to use the global DefaultDateFormat variable in config.php to determine
format of dates required. Changed demo default to US format 'm/d/Y'

<P>SelectOrderItems.php can now select items with no prices set up for them - including kits
Customer special prices now comes up as a seperate item in the search -
the system will show the normal price part as well as the special price one.
SelectProduct.php removed the link to special customer prices in the case of a kit set parts.

<P>BOM.php - BOM Maintnenance - Effective dates were modified by the code to be in SQL format on submit
and appeared corrupt on the next viewing. Fixed.
Effective dates were not displayed in accordance with DefaultDateFormat - fixed.
Now check to ensure components cannot be on the BOM more than once.
Pass db handle by reference to check recursion function to eliminate errors.

<P>BOM table modified EffectiveTo and EffectiveAfter to be Date fields not DateTime as was.

<P>Shippers.php - Shipping company maintenance - deletion of shipping companies failed - fixed.

<P>Prices.php - should not be able to enter prices against a kit since a kit is exploded into its components.

<P>SelectProduct.php - dont show prices link for kitset products.

<P>Modified PDF_TranPageHeader.inc to refer to YPos rather than hard code vertical coordinates for credit notes
so that alternate paper sizes can be accomodated. Fixed invoices 20 Jan forgot credit notes.

<P>Created SuppCreditGRNs.php - this page allows selection of goods received records for entering supplier credits
against. Similar to the SuppInvGRNs.php but shows all goods received records after a specified date. The invoice
entry page only shows goods received records that are yet to be fully invoiced. The credit note needs to show
all goods received records.

<P>Now have SupplierCredit.php working creating GL entries as appropriate and shipment charge records etc.

<P>
<HR>
<P>Version 0.1.2

<P>20 Jan 03

<P>Modified PDF_TranPageHeader.inc to refer to YPos rather than hard code vertical coordinates so that alternate
paper sizes can be accomodated. (only fixed invoices - credit notes fixed 28th Jan 03)

<P>Noted that pdf reports for Purchase orders did not print in Konqueror but worked fine in Netscape and Opera 6.1
No modifications - bug in Konqueror

<P>SupplierInvoice.php - stopped the script trying to update shipment 0 even though no shipment defined.

<P>WWW_Users table now has page size field varchar(20) was char(2) to allow proper description of page size.
There was a mismatch between PDFStarter.inc switch statements and the stored values in WWW_Users table.
Also modified WWW_Users.php to allow selection of other page sizes.

<P>SelectProduct.php now checks for the existence of any stock categories before proceding and insists on some
beng set up showing a link to the StockCategories.php script.

<P>CustomerBranches.php: Check for existence of Sales Types, Sales Areas and Stock Locations
before allowing input of branches with a null items in these fields.

<P>SalesAnalReptCols.php: Bug in sales analysis column definitions
BudgetOrActual field was used the opposite way in creating reports script SalesAnalysis_UserDefined.php.
Modified the select box BudgetOrActual to be 1 for Budget and 0 for Actual (NOT budget).
Also modified so that the returned 1 or 0 interpreted correctly on display of the column details from the
printf statement.

<P><HR>
<P>Version 0.1.1

<P>11 Jan 03
