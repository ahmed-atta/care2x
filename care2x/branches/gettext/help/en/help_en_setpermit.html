<p><strong>Setting an access permission</strong></p>

<p>Due to high security requirements in health care systems, you cannot create an access permission all by yourself. The access permission is usually created for you by a designated employee in the IT department of your organization.</p>

<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>

<p>Apply for an access permission through the official channels as outlined in your organization's rules and regulations. You can try the following contact information:</p>

<blockquote>Name of designated person:<br />
Department's address:<br />
Telephone nr:<br />
Fax nr:<br />
Intercom nr:

<p>Application form</p>
