1. Introduction
------------------

Care2x HIS is a smart software for hospitals and health care organizations. 
It is designed to integrate the different information systems existing in 
these organizations into one single efficient system.

Care2x HIS solves the problems inherent in a network of multiple programs 
that are noncompatible with each other. It can integrate almost any type of 
services, systems, departments, clinic, processes, data, communication, etc. 
that exist in a hospital. Its design can even handle non-medical services or 
functions like security, maintenance, etc. It is modular and highly scalable.

Care2x HIS uses a standard SQL database format for storing and retrieving 
data. The use of a single data format solves the problem of data redundancy. 
When configured accordingly, it can support multiple database configuration 
to enhance data security and integrity.

It is a web based software and all its functions can be accessed with a 
common web browser thus there is no need for a special user interface 
software. All program modules are processed on the server side. Module 
updates and extensions do not require changes on the browsers thus there are 
no network interruptions and downtimes. Its design supports multiple server 
configuration to distribute traffic and improve speed and efficiency.

Care2x HIS is an open source development (OSD) project and distributed with a 
"GNU General Public License". Its source code is freely-distributed and 
available to the general public. Please have a look to the LICENSE file for
