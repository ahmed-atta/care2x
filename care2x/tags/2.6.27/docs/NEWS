2nd Generation Deployment 2.1 version
----------------------------------------

A. "Deployment" status

  * Care2x uses the term "deployment" instead of "stable".
  * Why "deployment" ?

        Care2x is actually quite stable that it does deserve to be labeled as 
stable, but some language versions are not 100% complete. However, these 
incomplete language versions DO NOT hinder the reliability of the application. 

NOTE: This release is not officially recommended to update the existing 
Deployment 1.1 !
